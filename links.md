# Links

The `<a>` tag links to another document, like this:

```
<a href="about.html">About</a>
```

The above appears as a link to the `about.html` page on the same site, and will appear as "About," like this:

[About](about.html)  

The `href` in the link tag gives the address of the page. This kind of secondary information in tags is called an "attribute." The `href` attribute stands for hypertext reference. 

You can also reference other sites with `href`:

```
<a href="http://www.google.com">
```

Which appears as:

<a href="http://www.google.com">

Links defined like this are called "abolute" links, since they describe the whole url. Links that describe the URL in relation to the page you're on, like the About example above, are called "relative" links. Use relative links when referring to pages on your own site so that your site won't break when it's moved.
